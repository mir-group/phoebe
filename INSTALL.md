# Building Phoebe
The installation requires:
* CMake
* C++ compiler with C++14 support. We regularly test with GCC, but Intel and Clang have also worked.
* Internet connection (we will download external libraries)

Optionally, Phoebe can also use MPI, OpenMP and CUDA, as described below.

Two executables will be created:
* phoebe
* runTests (for developers)

## Basic build procedure
```
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

This will build a basic version of Phoebe, with MPI and OpenMP if available.
Often, you can receive additional acceleration by following the OMP env variable
instructions from Kokkos:

  "In general, for best performance with OpenMP 4.0 or better set OMP_PROC_BIND=spread and OMP_PLACES=threads
  For best performance with OpenMP 3.1 set OMP_PROC_BIND=true."

## CUDA build
```
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=ON -DKokkos_ARCH_VOLTA70=ON
make -j$(nproc)
```
Replace `VOLTA70` (which is for V100s) with the arch of your GPU.

## Kokkos
Phoebe utilizes Kokkos to generate either OpenMP or CUDA code to accelerate parts of the code.
Thus Phoebe accepts all the CMake arguments of Kokkos, which can improve performance.
For example, you should specify `-DKokkos_ARCH_KNL=ON` when building for Knight's Landing nodes.


## Documentation
In order to compile the documentation, you need to have installed:
* doxygen
* graphviz
Then type
* `make doc`


## Notes for Mac Users:
There can be trouble linking to the libgfortran files required by scalapack.
If libgfortran is not found, try adding it specifically to LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
```
export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libgfortran/
```
If using homebrew installed gcc, you might need to add the cellar copy rather than the
one located with gcc:
```
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/12/
```
