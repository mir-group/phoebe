/** This is a highly specialized auxiliary class, whose sole purpose is to
 * optimize the construction of the phonon scattering matrix.
 * It is used to efficiently return the harmonic information (energy, velocity,
 * and Bose--Einstein distribution) of the third states in the phonon
 * scattering, i.e. at the points q3 = q1 + q2 and q3 = q1-q2.
 *
 * This class handle three cases.
 * 1) If, in the scattering matrix, inner=outer band structure, and the mesh on
 * which the band structure is computed is a FullPoints class, then, the
 * q3-band structure = inner = outer band structure. In this case, Helper3rdState
 * returns information from the innerBandStructure without need for recomputing
 * anything.
 * 2) If, in the scattering matrix, inner=outer band structure, but the mesh on
 * which the band structure is computed is not a FullPoints class (e.g. after we
 * applied a window), then, some values of q3 may not fall on the inner or
 * outer band structure. In this case, we recompute the q3-band structure for all
 * the values that will be needed in the calculation.
 * 3) If, in the scattering matrix, inner is not equal to the outer
 * band structure, q3 is a generic point. Since storing all values of q3 might
 * take too much memory, we proceed in this way. Since the phonon scattering
 * matrix has an outer loop over q2, we compute at once all the band structure
 * for the values of all q3 such that q3 = q1 +- q2 for a fixed q2. Then, we
 * can quickly retrieve the info at each value of q3.
